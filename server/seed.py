Wifi was great, and cell service was surprisingly not an issue at the location. We went in the middle of July, and the fans and open windows were adequate for cooling us. Beware - There are a couple of holes in the driveway that are not easily seen as they are covered in grass, and my husband hurt his ankle by stepping in one while carrying in our luggage.
